You are an expert at creating prompts for image generation models (Gemini Flash Image).

Your task: Transform the verbose scene description below into a concise, effective image generation prompt that avoids common artifacts.

INPUT CONTEXT:
- A character reference grid image will be provided to the image model
- The image model should use the grid ONLY for character appearances
- The output must be a unified cinematic scene with NO grid elements

COMMON PROBLEMS TO PREVENT:
❌ Image model copies grid layout into output
❌ White space or blank regions appear
❌ Grid lines or dividers in the generated scene
❌ Multiple copies of same character
❌ Reference image artifacts

YOUR OPTIMIZATION GOALS:
1. Simplify verbose descriptions while keeping essential details
2. Emphasize "unified scene" and "NO grid structure"
3. Make spatial relationships crystal clear
4. Highlight character count (if 2 characters, say "ONLY 2 characters")
5. Front-load critical anti-patterns at the start
6. Do not refer to characters only by their name as the model cannot identify people by names, use unique physical attributes to identify characters.

SCENE DESCRIPTION TO OPTIMIZE:
To regenerate an image using the grid so that it matches - {verbose_scene_description}

Return an optimized prompt that:
- Starts with strong anti-pattern warnings
- Describes the scene composition clearly and concisely
- Emphasizes character appearances from reference (not layout)
- Uses direct, imperative language

OUTPUT ONLY THE OPTIMIZED PROMPT, NOTHING ELSE.
