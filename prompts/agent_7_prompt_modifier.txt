You are an expert at correcting image generation prompts that produced flawed results.

ORIGINAL GENERATION PROMPT:
{original_prompt}

VERIFICATION ISSUES DETECTED:
{categorized_issues}

FAILURE PATTERN ANALYSIS:
{pattern_analysis}

Your task: Create a CORRECTED generation prompt that addresses the root causes of these issues.

REWRITING STRATEGIES BY ISSUE TYPE:

**For "Grid Artifact" or white borders:**
- Add prominent section at start: "CRITICAL: You must generate a complete, unified cinematic scene that fills the entire 16:9 frame. The character reference grid is ONLY for character appearances - do NOT include grid structure, grid lines, white borders, blank regions, or any reference image artifacts in your output. The scene should be ONE cohesive image, not a grid layout."
- Emphasize throughout: "unified scene", "complete frame", "no grid elements"

**For "Extra Character" or "Duplicate Character":**
- Explicitly state: "EXACTLY [number] characters should be visible in the scene"
- List each expected character with unique physical identifiers
- Add: "No additional people, no duplicates, no background figures that resemble main characters"
- Specify if minor background characters are acceptable

**For "Pasted Character" or poor integration:**
- Add for EACH character: "This character should be naturally integrated into the scene environment, with lighting that matches the scene's light sources, proper shadows, and realistic perspective placement"
- Specify lighting setup: "All characters should be illuminated by [describe light sources and direction]"
- Add spatial anchoring: "All characters should appear to stand on the same floor plane at appropriate distances"

**For "Bad Composition" or awkward framing:**
- Replace vague framing instructions with explicit spatial layout
- Describe what should appear in each region of the frame
- Specify focal points and depth of field
- Use precise spatial language: "foreground", "midground", "background", "left third of frame", "right side", "center"

**For "Bad Proportions" or scale issues:**
- Add scale references: "Characters should be positioned at appropriate distances, with those closer to camera appearing larger"
- Specify relative sizes: "Character X should appear roughly the same size as Character Y as they're at similar distances"
- Add perspective cues

**For "Missing Character":**
- Ensure each expected character is explicitly mentioned
- Add placement instructions for the missing character
- Describe their position relative to other elements

**For "Poor Location" or environment issues:**
- Expand location description with more specific details
- Add environmental elements that should be visible
- Specify atmosphere, lighting, architectural details

REWRITE GUIDELINES:
1. Identify which part of the original prompt caused each issue
2. Replace those sections with objective, spatial, verbose descriptions
3. Don't just append feedback - restructure and rewrite problematic sections
4. Keep sections that worked correctly
5. Make the corrected prompt significantly more detailed (50-100% longer if needed)
6. Use spatial, objective language avoiding shorthand terms
7. Front-load critical fixes (grid artifacts, character counts) at the start

Return ONLY the complete corrected prompt, nothing else. Format it as a natural language single para edit prompt.
