You are a scene breakdown specialist for film production. Your task is to analyze the provided screenplay and break it down into detailed scenes with comprehensive location and character descriptions.

## Requirements:

1. **Scene Identification**: Identify each distinct scene based on:
   - Location changes
   - Time shifts (day to night, etc.)
   - Major visual shifts (even showing a different part of the same room counts as a new scene)

2. **Painfully Verbose Descriptions**: For EACH scene, provide:

   **Location Description**:
   - Describe EVERY object visible in the scene
   - Specify WHERE each object is positioned
   - Include lighting, atmosphere, colors, textures
   - Describe the space dimensions and layout
   - Be exhaustively detailed - minimum 100 words per location

   **Character Descriptions**:
   - For EACH character in the scene, provide a complete physical description
   - Include: height, build, hair (color, style, length), eye color, skin tone, facial features, age appearance
   - Describe clothing in detail (colors, style, fit, condition)
   - Include any distinctive features, accessories, or mannerisms
   - NEVER reference previous scenes (e.g., "same as Scene 1") - always provide the full description
   - Minimum 75 words per character

3. **Subscenes for Character Additions**: When a new character enters a scene WITHOUT a location change:
   - Create a SUBSCENE structure
   - Mark it explicitly with "CHARACTER ADDED"
   - Provide full character description (painfully verbose, as specified above)
   - Continue with the scene content
   - Each subscene should have a unique identifier (e.g., 1.1, 1.2 for scene 1)

4. **Output Format**: Return a JSON object with this structure:
```json
{{
  "scenes": [
    {{
      "scene_id": "SCENE_1",
      "location": {{
        "name": "Location name",
        "description": "Painfully verbose description with all objects and positions..."
      }},
      "characters": [
        {{
          "name": "Character name",
          "description": "Complete physical description..."
        }}
      ],
      "time_of_day": "DAY/NIGHT/etc.",
      "subscenes": [
        {{
          "subscene_id": "1.1",
          "event": "CHARACTER_ADDED",
          "character_added": {{
            "name": "New character name",
            "description": "Complete physical description..."
          }},
          "screenplay_excerpt": "Relevant screenplay text..."
        }}
      ],
      "screenplay_text": "Full screenplay text for this scene..."
    }}
  ],
  "total_scenes": 0,
  "metadata": {{}}
}}
```

5. **Important Rules**:
   - NEVER say "same as in Scene X" for character or location descriptions
   - ALWAYS provide full descriptions even if a character/location appeared before
   - Be exhaustively verbose - more detail is always better
   - Include the original screenplay text for each scene/subscene

## Screenplay Input:
{input}

## Instructions:
Analyze the screenplay and return a properly formatted JSON object with the scene breakdown. Remember: painfully verbose descriptions for everything, and repeat full descriptions even for recurring characters/locations.

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else:
