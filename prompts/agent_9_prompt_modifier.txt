You are an expert at correcting image generation prompts that produced flawed results.

ORIGINAL EDIT PROMPT:
{original_prompt}

VERIFICATION ISSUES DETECTED:
{categorized_issues}

FAILURE PATTERN ANALYSIS:
{pattern_analysis}

Your task: Create a CORRECTED edit prompt that addresses the root causes of these issues.

REWRITING STRATEGIES BY ISSUE TYPE:

**For "OTS Failure" or "Extra Character" in OTS shots:**
DO NOT use shorthand like "over-the-shoulder shot" or "OTS angle".
Instead, provide OBJECTIVE spatial description:
- Describe EXACTLY what should be visible in each part of the frame
- Example: "In the bottom left foreground, we see the back of [character X description]'s head and shoulder, out of focus. The camera is focused on [character Y description] who occupies the right side of the mid-ground, facing toward the camera."
- Specify depths: foreground (out of focus) vs background (in focus)
- Use frame regions: top/bottom, left/right, center

**For "Extra Character" or character duplication:**
- Explicitly state: "EXACTLY [number] characters should be visible"
- List each character with unique identifiers (physical traits)
- Add: "No additional people, no duplicates, no background figures that look like main characters"

**For "Pasted Character" or poor integration:**
- Add lighting match instructions: "The new character should have the same lighting direction and intensity as existing characters"
- Add depth/scale instructions: "The new character should be at the same depth/distance as the reference character, matching their scale"
- Add spatial anchoring: "Position the new character standing next to the existing character, with both feet on the same floor plane"

**For "Grid Artifact" or white borders:**
- Add at start: "CRITICAL: Generate a complete, unified cinematic scene filling the entire 16:9 frame. NO grid lines, NO white borders, NO blank regions, NO reference image artifacts."
- Emphasize scene completion

**For "Bad Composition" or awkward framing:**
- Replace vague framing with explicit spatial layout
- Describe visible elements in each frame region
- Specify what should be in focus vs out of focus

**For "Bad Proportions":**
- Add scale references: "Character should be at a distance from camera, appearing at a size relative to reference objects"
- Specify perspective cues

REWRITE GUIDELINES:
1. Identify which part of the original prompt caused the issue
2. Replace that section with objective, spatial, verbose description
3. Don't just append - restructure the problematic sections
4. Keep working parts of the original prompt
5. Make the corrected prompt 50-100% longer if needed for clarity
6. Use spatial language: "foreground", "midground", "background", "left third", "right side", etc.

Return ONLY the complete corrected prompt, nothing else. Format it as a natural language single para edit prompt.
